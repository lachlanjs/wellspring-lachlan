*more federated learning, and ðŸŽ¹*

I've been hastily throwing together a presentation - which has been a nice way to recap on the project.

I've also been recording and working on a piano composition that I came up with a few years ago and titled "Life is Short". I think it used to be in 21/8 (consecutive bars of 11 and 10), and now I've reworked it into 12/8, adding a beat to both the 11 and the 10 and an then an extra one to the 10.

I might put it up here later this afternoon...
