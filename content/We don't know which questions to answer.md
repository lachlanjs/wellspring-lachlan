At times I have lost myself in (probably) unanswerable questions. Short-term, maybe good. Long-term, definitely bad. 

The struggle makes it feel worthwhile; like it's going somewhere: 
"Just you wait and see...".
You get tunnel vision, which serves you right for entering a tunnel. Tunnels can be dark.

Have you ever wondered what you would do if you were in a road tunnel and a segment of it collapsed? If there was a fiery car crash, or a partial flood?

The answer is yes, they do. It's a legal thing. 

You don't notice them when you're getting along at 100kph. If you come to a stop, you will probably find one.

There is no way of knowing whether an answer lies at the end of a question that doesn't involve pushing on through it and witnessing it yourself. So how do you justify leaving? 

By using your imagination. Imagine that you have an answer. Maybe you know roughly what the answer is anyway. Maybe it's one of very few things. Imagine: What will you do with the answer? That in itself is a question that you should keep a very short leash on. If you don't know almost immediately what you would do with the answer if you had it; if there is no side-benefit in seeking it; find a question worth answering. There's nothing more noble than using your time wisely. Sometimes that means changing your plans, as long as you are honest about it.

How many questions that have caused you great concern, demanding your time and attention, befit this description? That are unanswerable, practically insignificant, or both?
- What happens after death?
- What do they truly think?
- What is the meaning of life?
- "Why do you love me/her/him/them?"
- Will we reach the stars?
- Do I deserve this?
