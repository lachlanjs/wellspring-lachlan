At times, I have lost myself in (probably) unanswerable questions. Short-term, maybe worth it. Long-term, definitely not. 

The struggle makes it feel worthwhile; like it's going somewhere.

``Just you wait and see..."

You get tunnel vision, which serves you right for entering a tunnel.

Tunnels are famously dark.

Have you ever wondered what you would do if you were in a road tunnel and a segment of it collapsed? If there was a fiery car crash, or a partial flood?

The answer is yes, they do. It's a legal thing. 

You don't notice them when you're getting along at 100kph. If you come to a stop, you will probably find one.

There is no way of knowing whether an answer lies at the end of a question that doesn't involve pushing on through it and witnessing it yourself. So how do you justify your escape? 

By using your imagination. Imagine that you have an answer. Maybe you know roughly what the answer is anyway. Maybe it's one of very few things. Imagine: What will you do with the answer? That in itself is a question that you should keep a very short leash on. If you don't know almost immediately (what you would do with the answer, if you believed in one); if there is no side-benefit in seeking it; find a question that is **worth answering**. There's nothing more noble than spending your time wisely. Sometimes that involves editing your plans, honestly.

And so I wonder how many questions cause us great concern, demand our time and attention, yet fit the description of:
1. unanswerable
	
	or
2. practically insignificant

- What is the meaning of life?
- ``Why do you love me/her/him/them?"
- Will we reach the stars?
- Do I deserve this?
