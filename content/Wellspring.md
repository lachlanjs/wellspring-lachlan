*Consciousness and the meaning of life's experience through it*

---
I think a wellspring is a good metaphor for human consciousness. 

There are good reasons to become concerned about consciousness. It makes our experience of the universe special. It makes our experience of the universe exist at all. It is responsible for logic, emotion and morality. Any time that these things give you cause for contemplation, you have cause to contemplate consciousness.

Our understanding of consciousness is inversely proportional to its importance. We understand almost nothing; *practically* nothing, and this is the essence of what I have to say about it. It's extremely noble to contribute to understanding consciousness better, but unless a useful understanding arises with practical ramifications, something pragmatic should take precedence. 

If you are a determinist, first and foremost, then you believe that there are mechanics underlying consciousness which are governed by unchanging laws. Your logic, emotions and morals are therefore governed by something unbeknownst to, and uninfluenced by, you. I find this perfectly appealing, and it is supported by evidence that you can experience at any time. How so? You simply have to notice that the artefacts of your consciousness arise on their own. Good luck trying to sit still and not think of anything, something will inevitably *well* up from within you. You won't know from where it came or why it came.

**No**. Notice that the universe has not collapsed upon you because you've dared to think this. It does not reach out and smack you in the head. You don't involuntarily find yourself arrested in your chair never to move again or make any conscious effort towards anything. You don't suddenly act as though you have lost your mind, because you haven't. Everything is still right where it is and will ever be.

Rather than becoming disarmed, you are armed with freedom from the questions you have about the deeper meaning of your life. The simple observation above has done this.

Why bother with a deeper meaning to your life anyway? I understand why *The* question arises, (it's a bubble rising from your wellspring, fair enough) but pursuing an answer is another thing entirely. I believe that it is worth pursuing questions where the answer can be expected to have practical ramifications. An answer to the deeper meaning of life may not exist and would not have practical ramifications. An answer could not help you with your actions, because your actions were never in your control to begin with.

You will, from now on, experience the same logic, emotions, and moral instincts. Within this it is still perfectly acceptable to *feel* that you are in control and that what you do matters. Go about your day according to your moral code and your rules and your values. Change them if it occurs to you to do so. It has no less meaning now than when you started reading.
