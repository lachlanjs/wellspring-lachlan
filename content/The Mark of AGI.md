*what will AGI be?*

---
AGI will not be achieved merely "when an AI system makes new discoveries that humans have not yet made". There are plenty of ways to put new dots on a sparse map, i.e. by just joining together two existing points. If an AI system pinpoints something that is already in the convex hull of all human knowledge / data, then one should be pleased and excited, but not surprised. 

However, if an artificial intelligence system creates something that is genuinely out of the bounds of our current human knowledge, that would be a true marvel. Not only that, it would be impossible to define what such a step would look like. If we could describe it, then this would violate the notion that it is outside of the bounds of our current human knowledge. Our best estimate for the verification of the event will be found at the extremes of our instantaneous collective surprise.
