# Hello! Thanks for being here
This is my personal website. I hope that if you are here then there is something that is of use to you.
I thank you for being here because you have given value to this website, and I appreciate that. I hope I repay you. I wish you the best.
# What, Why?
I feel that there is value in recording the details of life. What better to do with our evolved writing abilities? Life is brimming with transitory thoughts, knowledge, and experiences. I wish to persist some. You will find those things from my life here.

# Where?
- [[My Life's Work]] - things I'm working on
- [[Philosophy]] - things I think
- [[Knowledge]] - things I know (allegedly)
# How?
This website was created using: 
- [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) for SSG
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for editing
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting
These things are free - I mean... wow...

If you think this is cool and want to do your own one then just check out these links - it's incredibly easy and extensible. 
# When?
I made this website as soon as I found the tools above. In particular, I needed something with a range of features so that I could collect everything in one place. Also, I'm lazy - the tools had to be easy to use. Obsidian offered the right format and feature set. Quartz offered the easiest way to turn it into a website. Github pages offered the best way to put it out there. The stars aligned.
