# How?
This website was created using: 
- [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) for SSG
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for editing
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting

These things are free - I mean... wow... nice one.
I think you should do your own one,  just check out these links - it's incredibly easy and extensible.

# When?
I made this website as soon as I found the tools above. In particular, I needed something with a range of features so that I could collect everything in one place. Also, I'm lazy - the tools had to be easy to use. Markdown offers a good medium. Obsidian offered a good editor. Quartz offered the easiest way to turn it into a website. Github pages offered the best way to put it out there. The stars aligned and I happened to notice.
