"*Attentionism*". Google it. It seems the word is unclaimed. This word captures a perspective on value that I discovered last night.

**Axiom:** Value is assigned by conscious attention. 

No more. No less. I see this idea as pragmatic. Immediately, you can consider what is valuable to you and to others. It does not leave you with a 'set of values' that you could find disagreement with, and it does not leave you with no value at all, something nihilistic philosophy does.

Wanting not to forget this idea, I wrote to myself late last night:

> You are ineradicably bestowed with attention. In your waking experience you will only ever find yourself with your attention placed. One could define meaningful(/valuable) things as those which are attended to.

## Compatibility with stances on free will
You can believe that either you have free will, or you don't, and this will be compatible with this definition of value. I personally do not believe in "free will". I believe that our what we act on (instincts/thoughts/feelings/impulses/conditioning) are unconscious to us in their origin at every waking moment. Taking either stance on free will can leave one feeling empty. "*What now?*". Attentionism acknowledges that your natural, ineradicable and continuous attentive facilities exist regardless of your belief in free will - what is valuable will be assigned by you with or without your choice. 
## Application
With Attentionism you can crystallise the valuable things in your life: 
- By reading this text you have made it valuable
- By greeting someone you are making them valuable
- By acquiring items of knowledge you are making those valuable
Even if you were not aware of your attention changing, the thing that it changed to is valuable.
## Theft
The point made at the end of the last section is dark. Your attention can be stolen from you. It pays to be attentive to what may be doing this. Do you feel that you want your attention, and thus your capacity to generate value, to be out of your control?
