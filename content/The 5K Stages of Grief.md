*running as a metaphor*

---
I don't know much about grief, having not lost that many people I love. It'll happen to me some day, just as many good things will.

---
But I do like to think I know running 5ks. I think that maybe each kilometre of a 5K maps onto its respective stage:

> Okay, why is my pace dropping. I've literally just started. If I don't get the time I want, I'm going to be pissed. I swear I've run more than 1.5ks. Why have you got to call me in the middle of a run. \*\*\*\* this. Remember when $x$ said $y$ about me? \*\*\*\* them, I'll show them.

> Maybe 4ks is good enough for today. I mean it is the end of a longish day. And it's hot; the conditions probably aren't ideal. No one would really care if I didn't finish this thing... so why not just make things a little easier? Maybe if get to 3ks I'll have a rest, and then after that I'll do a 2k, and then another rest, and then a 1k. Then I'll have done 6ks. That would be even better right?

> This hurts, and the worst of it is yet to come. My calves are killing me. I'm not going to get a PB like I thought I was. There's no point to this anyway. Life hasn't changed just because I've gone for a run. People probably think my running updates are annoying and self-serving. This is the slowest kilometre I've done so far. I always go too hard at the start. I never learn.

> Well, it wasn't the run I was hoping for. But I'm nearly there. I'm going to make it. There are positives: I haven't stopped, I've kept my baseline. If I push hard now it will hurt but it will be over soon and then I can breathe. I just have to forget the pain for a moment and go.
