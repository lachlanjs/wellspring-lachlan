## Learning the Holoviz Ecosystem
Holoviz is a brilliant work-in-progress that is sure to empower data analytic developers to create what they have not previously had the time to. It does its job much better than the competition, as a free Python package, but scalable use of it is *sorcery*, for now.

I have learned to use this framework to develop a larger-scale [^1] data analytic application. The Holoviz ecosystem is very "learn as you go", and the gradient of your learning curve will be proportional to the ambition of your project. So will your visits to the issues section of the GitHub repository and the Discourse forum. You may find that you exhaust the documentation and the tutorials quite quickly.

For Holoviz, there is a considerable lack of larger-scale example applications. Holoviz *can* scale and *can* handle complex user-integrated experiences. If this is what you want to do, it will be helpful to have a playbook. I intend to share some of what has made its way into my playbook, under the provision that it is also appreciated as a work in progress in itself.
